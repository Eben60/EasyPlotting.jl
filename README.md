# easy_plotting.app
Statistical plotting GUI app. ***Minimal/no coding required to use.*** 

This is an attempt to create a working GUI app that creates selected scientific plots for user's datasets and user-defined custom options.

At the moment, only heatmap plotting is available. Additional plot types will be added in the future.

This GUI is coded in pure Julia. Only source scripts are uploaded at this point in time. In the near future, the Julia executable will be bundled with all its dependencies to create a Mac OS X app, possibly also adding options for Windows/Linux distributions.

If anyone would be willing to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request. If any issues, please also feel free to open an issue.
